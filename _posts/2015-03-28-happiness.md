I am taking a course on the Microeconomic foundations of happiness this semester. During the course of semester, I really got to think about what happiness truly is. Now, you may roll your eyes at the thought of happiness since the concept of it seems so platonic and useless to our daily lives. The course does not aim to define/investigate any of the platonic idea of happiness. Instead, it tries to quantify and analyze the daily definition of happiness that drives so much of our activities- activities that require complex strategies and coordination like paraglyding to dead simple activities like listening to the music or lying on a couch. 

Before we start discussing the idea of happiness, we need to start the discussion about what it means to engage in any activity.
